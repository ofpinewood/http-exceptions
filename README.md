Extensions for returning exceptions over HTTP e.g. as ASP.NET Core Problem Details.
Problem Details are a machine-readable format for specifying errors in HTTP API responses based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807.
But you are not limited to returning exception results as Problem Details, but you can create your own mappers for your own custom formats.
